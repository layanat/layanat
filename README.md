## Hi there 👋

### A little bit about me 🐙
Welcome to my space ✨

You can call me Lay, short for Layana. I Just graduated as valedectorian of the Gina Cody class of 2025 in Bachelors of Software Engineering👩🏻‍🎓

I'm passionate about web development and tackling new challenges. I like to think of myself as a fast learner who likes to take every opportunity to learn new skills (I try not to get too rusty) 😅

I have hands on experience with Web Development, Mobile Development, and DevOps Engineering 👩🏻‍💻 I enjoy working on Front End Web Development the most, just think about it, isn't it fun solving real world problems like centering a div? 🤌🏻

I love creating with like-minded individuals who are open to sharing experiences, and are great team players 🫸🏻🫷🏻
